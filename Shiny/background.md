# HERON UK: Concept Counts

This Shiny app, developed as part of the [HERON UK](https://heron-uk.github.io/heron-uk/) onboarding process, displays **concept-level counts** from an OMOP CDM database.

It includes:

- **Snapshot** — general CDM information such as person count and vocabulary version.  
- **Concept Counts** — record counts by `concept_id`, stratified by age, sex, and year (from 01/01/2012 to present).
